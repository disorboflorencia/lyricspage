  <h3>Lyrics</h3>
  <p>
    Have you got color in your cheeks? <br>
    Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift the type <br>
    That sticks around like summat in your teeth? <br>
    Are there some aces up your sleeve? <br>
    Have you no idea that you're in deep? <br>
    I've dreamt about you nearly every night this week <br>
    How many secrets can you keep? <br>
    'Cause there's this tune I found <br>
    That makes me think of you somehow and I play it on repeat <br>
    Until I fall asleep, spillin' drinks on my settee <br>
  </p> 
  <p>
    <element class="italic">(Do I wanna know?)</element> If this feelin' flows both ways? <br>
    <element class="italic">(Sad to see you go)</element> Was sorta hopin' that you'd stay <br>
    <element class="italic">(Baby, we both know)</element> That the nights were mainly made <br>
    For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day <br>
  </p>
  <p>
    Crawlin' back to you <br>
    Ever thought of callin' when <br>
    You've had a few? <br>
    'Cause I always do <br>
    Maybe I'm too <br>
    Busy being yours <br>
    To fall for somebody new <br>
    Now, I've thought it through <br>
    Crawlin' back to you <br>
  </p>
  <p>
    So have you got the guts? <br>
    Been wonderin' if your heart's still open <br>
    And if so, I wanna know what time it shuts <br>
    Simmer down and pucker up, I'm sorry to interrupt <br>
    It's just I'm constantly on the cusp of trying to kiss you <br>
    I don't know if you feel the same as I do <br>
    But we could be together if you wanted to <br>
  </p>
  <p>
    <element class="italic">(Do I wanna know?)</element> If this feelin' flows both ways? <br>
    <element class="italic">(Sad to see you go)</element> Was sorta hopin' that you'd stay <br>
    <element class="italic">(Baby, we both know)</element> That the nights were mainly made <br>
    For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day <br>
  </p>
  <p>
    Crawlin' back to you <element class="italic">(crawlin' back to you)</element>  <br>
    Ever thought of callin' when <br>
    You've had a few? <element class="italic">(You've had a few)</element>  <br>
    'Cause I always do <element class="italic">('cause I always do)</element>  <br>
    Maybe I'm too <element class="italic">(maybe I'm too busy)</element>  <br>
    Busy bein' yours <element class="italic">(bein' yours)</element>  <br>
    To fall for somebody new <br>
    Now, I've thought it through <br>
    Crawlin' back to you <br>
  </p>
  <p>
    <element class="italic">(Do I wanna know?)</element> If this feelin' flows both ways? <br>
    <element class="italic">(Sad to see you go)</element> Was sorta hoping that you'd stay <br>

    For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day <br>
    <element class="italic">(Do I wanna know?)</element> Too busy being yours to fall <br>
    <element class="italic">(Sad to see you go)</element> Ever thought of callin', darlin'? <br>
    <element class="italic">(Do I wanna know?)</element> Do you want me crawlin' back to you? <br>
